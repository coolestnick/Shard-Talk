# API Endpoint Fixes - Backend Resilience Update

## Problem Summary

Your production deployment at `https://shard-talk.vercel.app` was experiencing:
- **Hundreds of 500 Internal Server Errors** from the `/api/users` endpoint
- Backend crashing when MongoDB connection fails
- Poor user experience due to unhandled errors

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend Issue
The `/api/users` endpoint had **NO error handling** for MongoDB connection failures. When MongoDB was unavailable or connection failed, the endpoint would throw unhandled exceptions, resulting in 500 errors.

**Problematic code (before fix):**
```typescript
// No try-catch - crashes on DB connection failure
if (address) {
  const db = await getMongoDb()  // ❌ If this fails, 500 error
  const user = await db.collection('users').findOne({ address })
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ user }), { status: 200 })
}
```

### Frontend Issue (Already Fixed)
The excessive API calls were coming from **old deployed code** on Vercel. The local codebase already has the fix:
- `MessageList.tsx` lines 87-95 show **disabled** username fetching code
- Comment states: "Disabled: No longer fetching usernames from database anymore"
- The current local code does NOT make `/api/users` calls

**This means your Vercel deployment is running OLD CODE that still makes these calls.**

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Backend Error Handling (app/api/users/route.ts)

Added comprehensive error handling to **ALL** database operations:

#### GET Endpoint Improvements:
- **Wrapped entire handler in try-catch** to prevent any unhandled errors
- **Individual try-catch blocks** for each MongoDB operation
- **Returns 200 with null/empty data** instead of 500 when DB fails
- **Proper error logging** for debugging
- **Added Content-Type headers** for better response handling

**After fix:**
```typescript
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // ... validation code ...

    if (address) {
      try {
        const db = await getMongoDb()
        const user = await db.collection<UserDoc>('users').findOne({ address })
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ user }), {
          status: 200,
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
        })
      } catch (dbError: any) {
        console.error('Database error fetching user by address:', dbError)
        // ✅ Returns 200 with null user instead of crashing
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({
          error: 'Database connection failed',
          user: null
        }), {
          status: 200,
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
        })
      }
    }

    // Similar error handling for username lookup and pagination...

  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Unexpected error in GET /api/users:', error)
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
      error: 'Internal server error',
      message: error.message
    }), {
      status: 500,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    })
  }
}
```

#### POST Endpoint Improvements:
- **Nested try-catch** for better error isolation
- **503 status** for database failures (Service Unavailable) instead of generic 500
- **Maintains 409 status** for username conflicts
- **Proper error messages** returned to client

### ✅ 2. Enhanced /api/messages Endpoint (app/api/messages/route.ts)

Added comprehensive validation and error handling to the messages endpoint:

#### GET Endpoint Improvements:
- **Address validation**: Validates Ethereum address format before querying
- **Pagination validation**: Ensures page >= 1 and limit between 1-100
- **Database error handling**: Returns safe defaults on DB failures
- **Success field**: All responses now include `success: true/false` flag
- **Better error messages**: Clear, actionable error messages with examples

#### POST Endpoint Improvements:
- **JSON parsing validation**: Catches and reports malformed JSON
- **Field type validation**: Validates messageId is number, sender is valid address, etc.
- **Content sanitization**: Trims whitespace from message content
- **Better error responses**: Returns 503 (Service Unavailable) for DB issues instead of generic 500
- **Success messages**: Returns clear success/update messages

**Example Enhanced Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "address": "0x22d74adfb45147d7588afa3ba0ef1c363b7dfcff",
  "messageCount": 3
}
```

**Example Error Response with Guidance:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Address parameter is required",
  "example": "/api/messages?address=0x123...&count=true"
}
```

## Benefits of These Fixes

### 1. Backend is Now Resilient ✅
- **Never crashes** even when MongoDB is down
- **Graceful degradation** - returns null/empty data instead of errors
- **Better debugging** with detailed error logs
- **Prevents 500 errors** that trigger infinite retries

### 2. Better User Experience ✅
- Users can still interact with the app even if user lookup fails
- Clear error messages instead of generic failures
- No more browser console spam from 500 errors

### 3. Works with Circuit Breaker ✅
- Since we return 200 instead of 500 for DB failures:
  - Circuit breaker won't open unnecessarily
  - Frontend doesn't retry failed requests
  - Reduces server load during outages

## Required Action: Deploy to Vercel

**CRITICAL:** The local codebase is already fixed, but your Vercel deployment is running old code. You MUST redeploy to fix the production issue.

### Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your `shard-talk` project

2. **Redeploy Latest Code:**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Find the latest deployment
   - Click three dots (⋮) → "Redeploy"
   - Select "Use existing Build Cache" or "Rebuild" (Rebuild recommended)

3. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure these are set:
     - `MONGODB_URI` (REQUIRED!)
     - `MONGODB_DB` (should be "shardtalk")
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`

### Option 2: Deploy from Git

If you're using Git-based deployments:

```bash
# Commit the changes
git add app/api/users/route.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Add comprehensive error handling to /api/users endpoint

- Add try-catch blocks for all database operations
- Return 200 with null data instead of 500 on DB failures
- Improve error logging and response headers
- Use 503 for service unavailable errors
- Prevents infinite retry loops from 500 errors"

# Push to your main/master branch
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the changes.

### Option 3: Deploy from CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not installed
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

---

## Testing After Deployment

### 1. Test API Endpoint Directly
```bash
# Should return 200 with user data or null (not 500)
curl -I "https://shard-talk.vercel.app/api/users?address=0x22D74ADFB45147d7588aFA3ba0eF1c363b7dFcFF"

# Should return 200 OK, not 500
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
```

### 2. Check Browser Console
- Open https://shard-talk.vercel.app
- Open DevTools → Console
- Should see NO `/api/users` errors
- If you still see errors, clear browser cache and reload

### 3. Monitor Vercel Logs
- Dashboard → Your Project → Logs
- Should see proper error logging if DB issues occur
- Should NOT see unhandled errors or crashes

2. Verify environment variables are set (especially `MONGODB_URI`)
3. Test the production site after deployment
4. Monitor logs to ensure errors are handled properly

---

## Technical Details

### Error Handling Strategy

The fixes follow a **graceful degradation** strategy:

1. **Try to execute the operation** (get user, check username, etc.)
2. **If it fails**, return a safe default value instead of crashing:
   - User lookup failure → Return `{ user: null }`
   - Username check failure → Return `{ available: true }` (assume available)
   - List users failure → Return `{ items: [], total: 0 }`
3. **Log the error** for debugging
4. **Return 200 status** so frontend doesn't retry unnecessarily
5. **Include error field** in response so frontend knows what happened

### Why Return 200 Instead of 500?

**Traditional approach** (causes problems):
```
Request fails → 500 error → Circuit breaker opens → More 500s → Infinite loop
```

**Our approach** (better):
```
Request fails → 200 with null → Circuit breaker stays closed → App continues working
```

This prevents the retry spiral while still informing the frontend about the issue through the error field in the response.

## Monitoring Checklist

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] No 500 errors in browser console
- [ ] No excessive `/api/users` calls (should be 0 in current code)
- [ ] Vercel logs show proper error handling
- [ ] MongoDB connection issues are logged but don't crash the app
- [ ] Circuit breaker stays closed (check for "Circuit breaker opened" messages)
- [ ] User experience is smooth even with intermittent DB issues

---

## Additional Notes

### Circuit Breaker (Already in Place)
The codebase already has a circuit breaker (`lib/api/safe-fetch.ts`) that:
- Opens after 3 consecutive failures
- Blocks requests for 60 seconds
- Prevents infinite retry loops

### QueryClient Configuration (Already in Place)
The QueryClient (`app/providers.tsx`) already has:
- Smart retry logic (doesn't retry 4xx/5xx errors)
- Exponential backoff
- Disabled automatic refetching

### Why This Happened
1. Old code in `MessageList.tsx` was fetching user data for every message
2. This code was **disabled locally** but **still deployed on Vercel**
3. When MongoDB had issues, the API returned 500 errors
4. These 500 errors might have triggered retries from the old frontend code
5. Result: Hundreds of failed requests

---

## Questions or Issues?

If you continue seeing issues after redeployment:

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Check Vercel environment variables** (especially `MONGODB_URI`)
3. **Verify MongoDB is accessible** from Vercel
4. **Check Vercel logs** for specific error messages
5. **Check that latest code is deployed** (verify file changes on Vercel)

---
